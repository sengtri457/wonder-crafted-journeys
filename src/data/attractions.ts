    longDesc: "Siem Reap is packed with attractions – although the first that springs to most people's mind is the legendary Angkor Wat – both in itself an attraction and an activity.

Southeast Asia's largest freshwater lake, Tonle Sap is also nearby – with its unique water flow. Still on a watery theme the River of a thousand Lingas with its carved rocks is another must see.",
